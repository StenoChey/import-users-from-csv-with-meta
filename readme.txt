A plugin to import users using CSV files to WP database automatically including custom user meta

== Description ==

Clean and easy-to-use Import users plugin. It includes custom user meta to be included automatically from a CSV file and delimitation auto-detector.

## **Basics**

*   Import users from a CSV easily
*   And also extra profile information with the user meta data (included in the CSV with your custom fields)
*   Just upload the CSV file (one included as example)
*   All your users will be created/updated with the updated information, and of course including the user meta
*   Autodetect delimiter compatible with `comma , `, `semicolon ; ` and `bar | `

## **Usage**

Once the plugin is installed you can use it. Go to Tools menu and there, there will be a section called _Insert users from CSV_. Just choose your CSV file and go!

### **CSV generation**

You can generate CSV file with all users inside it, using a standar spreadsheet software like: Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc, OpenOffice Calc or Gnumeric.

You have to create the file filled with information (or take it from another database) and you will only have to choose CSV file when you "Save as..." the file. As example, a CSV file is included with the plugin.

### **Some considerations**

Plugin will automatically detect:

* Charset and set it to **UTF-8** to prevent problems with non-ASCII characters.
* It also will **auto detect line-ending** to prevent problems with different OS.
* Finally, it will **detect the delimiter** being used in CSV file ("," or ";" or "|")
